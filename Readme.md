# Wisp

Wisp is [homoiconic][homoiconicity] JS dialect with a [clojure] syntax,
[s-expressions] and [macros]. Wisp code compiles to a human readable
javascript, which is one of they key differences from [clojurescript]. It
attempts to compile to a JS code that you would have written yourself if you
were writing in pure JS, think of wisp as [markdown] for JS programing!

[Homoiconic][homoiconicity] syntax and [macros] are the primary motivations!
